Remote sensing has a rich history in environmental conservation, meteorology,
climate science and other fields. Due to this history remote sensing experts
have become very good at analyzing remote sensing data. Yet, remote sensing
image analysis implicitly incorporates the expertise and knowledge of the
individual performing the analysis and reduces objectivity. This can be divided
into remote sensing knowledge (spectral signature, remote sensing index, etc.)
and field knowledge (feature properties, spatial relations, etc)
\citep{Andres2013a}. This knowledge is often neither completely nor explicitly
defined but influences the classification. Thus, two experts can interpret the
same image differently due to their unique conceptualizations and experiences.
Further complicating matters, the classification chain is not documented and
controlled, reducing comparability and hindering attempts to reproduce the
results\citep{Arvor2013}. Therefore automated methods for remote sensing
classifications that produce accurate and reproducible results are desired.
An automated system would also reduce the time needed to analyze large
remote sensing datasets. Many approaches have been used to create an accurate
automated classification tool using statistics and different algorithms
from machine learning and data mining. Unfortunately most of these approaches
rely on experts to produce rule-sets or manually select training points. The
former relies on \emph{a priori} knowledge while the latter can be
time-consuming.
Neither are observation-based. There are many different automatic methods
for feature selection. A brief overview explaining the most common methods is
described below.


One of the goals of the projects is
multi-functionality which entails differing semantic conceptualizations. The use
of ontologies and ontology-based reasoning over vector objects was seen as the
solution to this problem. Using ontologies with the help of experts allows for
the translation from the Rhineland-Palatinate biotope system to the EU-wide EU
Nature Information System (EUNIS). Ontologies also allows
for comparison between areas with differing semantic conceptualizations and a
reasoning over objects.

Yet as Lucas et. al (2015) point out there are no standards for classifying
habitats with Earth Observation (EO) data that can be applied to all sites. 

Due to differing standards and approaches of the various nature conservation
agencies in collecting and disseminating information, data comparison is
difficult. Different data types and data sources increase the difficulty in
comparing data from one site to another. Furthermore, habitat monitoring can
be labour intensive and subjective.

Luckily, EO data could help reduce the burden of environmental monitoring and
also provide information on conservation status.
