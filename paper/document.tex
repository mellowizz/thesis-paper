\section{Introduction}
Recognizing the importance of functioning habitats to reduce biodiversity loss, 
the European Union has implemented an environmental conservation framework to 
protect and conserve vital habitats in accordance with the Convention on 
Biological Diversity. An integral part of this framework is the EU 
Habitats Directive (Council Directive) 92/43/EEC [1992], which established the 
Natura 2000 network of habitats. The law requires conservation and monitoring 
of designated habitats by member states and for a report to be submitted every 
six years. Environmental data to determine biodiversity status must be 
collected to comply with the statute. Yet, comparing data used for these reports 
can be difficult due to varying data collection methods by the nature 
conservation authorities in each member state \citep{INSPIREdataspecs, INSPIRE}. 
The main issue lies in the subjective nature of field surveys to identify 
habitats \citep{Cherrill1999, Cherrill1999a, Nieland2015}. Furthermore, habitat 
status is mostly generated in bottom-up approaches taking into account the 
national and regional interpretation guidelines \citep{INSPIREdataspecs}. This 
subjective and time-consuming task of conducting field surveys could be 
partially replaced with an automated remote sensing (RS) method that uses  
Geographic Object-Based Image Analaysis(GEOBIA) and ontologies to reduce the 
subjectiveness, reduce costs and increase temporal resolution.
\\
Remote sensing combined with GEOBIA, which segments the image into homogeneous 
image objects \citep{Blaschke2010}, offers opportunities to automate and 
collect large amounts of computer-readable data useful for nature conservation 
and biodiversity monitoring \citep{Corbane2015, VandenBorre2011, Mayer2011}. 
Yet, RS image analysis implicitly incorporates the expertise and knowledge of 
the person performing the analysis and reduces objectivity. This can be divided 
into remote sensing knowledge (spectral signature, remote sensing index, etc.) 
and field knowledge (feature properties, spatial relations, etc) 
\citep{Andres2013a}. This knowledge is often neither completely nor explicitly 
defined as it is based on trial and error but influences the classification. To 
ensure accuracy and applicability of classification outputs for conservation, 
experts with detailed knowledge of the sites are needed to interpret the EO 
data. The distance between the high-level semantics used by the expert to 
describe events and domain concepts and the low-level information quantified 
from data is reffered to as the ``semantic gap''. An ontology, defined as ``an 
explicit specification of a conceptualization'' \citep{gruber1993} could help 
bridge the ``semantic gap'' and allow for better data transfer-ability, 
predictability, interchangeability, knowledge and workflow management and 
logical consistency. 
%Ontologies can solve the 
%``semantic gap'' and foster data exchange and reuse by formalizing knowledge 
%with standardized languages such as OWL.
% The ``semantic gap'' refers to the difference between the higher-level 
% descriptions by experts and what can be extracted from the visual data.
\\
%While different fields (medical imaging, security, etc.) have used 
% ontologies, only recently have ontologies been adopted in remote sensing 
% research. 
Moreover, through the use of reasoners (inference engines) 
that infer logical consequences over axioms and asserted facts one can discover 
new knowledge \citep{Arvor2013, Andres2013a}. RS and field expert knowledge can 
be digitized in ontologies, thus allowing for a hierarchy of concepts for 
improved automatic image annotation and retrieval using concepts from both 
fields to produce more accurate results 
\cite{Srikanth:2005:EOA:1076034.1076128}. Janowicz \cite{Janowicz2012} advocates 
for more observation-driven ontologies and for including machine learning, 
statistics and data mining to construct ontological primitives. While research 
on using observation-based ontologies for classifications is limited, the 
available research in RS using ontologies is briefly summarized below. \\
The EU-funded ``Biodiversity Multi-Source Monitoring System: From Space To
Species'' (BIO\_SOS) project seeks to develop tools to monitor and map protected
areas in the EU and uses ontologies modeled on the Land Cover Classification
System (LCCS) and the General Habitat Category (GHC) to achieve this goal
\citep{Arvor2013}. Using the taxonomy of the different classification systems
allows expert knowledge to be included in the process. Further work as part of
the project includes creation of a standardized
framework for habitat monitoring and mapping called the Earth Observation Data
for Habitat Montioring (EOD-HAM) system \citep{Lucas2015}. The system harnesses
knowledge from both remote sensing and ecology to classify Natura 2000 sites
using a hierarchical classification system. The EOD-HAM system uses both
pixel-based analysis and OBIA for greater classification accuracy but still
relies on a rule-base created by an expert. Other research includes
classification of urban building types using a three-layered architecture
\citep{diSciascio2013} and a semi-automated classification of urban building
using the Random Forest (RF) classifier to determine variable importance of
features from airborne laser scanner data \citep{Belgiu2014}. Ontologies have
also been paired with different algorithms to automatically acquire
classification rules: a genetic programming algorithm
\citep{Forestier2012470} and the C4.5 data mining algorithm
\citep{Sheeren2006ML}. Harnessing ontologies to improve spatial data
interoperability has been demonstrated by using ontological inference and
hierarchical matchmaking by Nieland et al. \citep{Nieland2015}. 
\\
Even though researchers recently developed a number of indicators using
different sensors for habitat evaluation \citep{Nagendra2013}, classification
procedures and rule-sets were not formalized to be computer readable and
therefore suffer from similar transferablity and reproducablity problems as
manual habitat mapping \citep{Arvor2013, Nieland2015}.
Therefore a formalized computer-readable ontology could help solve these
problems and allow scientists to see how the classification was performed and 
be aware of possible incompatibilities before combining datasets
\citep{Janowicz2012}. 
Furthermore, there is no standardized set of indicators
using RS for trans-national habitat evaluation \citep{Lucas2015}. Therefore,
technical solutions to increase interoperability by thematically harmonizing
environmental data and systematize data collection methods from remote sensing
inputs in an automated workflow is needed. This would allow decision-makers 
to better assess and compare outcomes.
\\
In this paper we propose an automated system that can
classify selected biotopes according to the European Union Nature Information
System (EUNIS) biotope classification schema using EO data, existing
thematic maps (biotope, forestry, etc.) and expert knowledge formalized in an
ontology. The biotope indicators serve as class labels for training data mining
algorithms which generate rules that can be imported into an ontology. Once the
rules and segmented objects are imported into the ontology, a reasoner can
perform reasoning classifying which objects belong to which class (A-Box 
reasoning) and how the classes are related (T-box reasoning). The combination 
of data mining algorithms with ontology-based classification has not yet been 
done and is a first in remote sensing research. This method contributes to the 
goal of empirically-derived rule creation and enhances data interoperability and 
comparison as proposed by Janowicz \citep{Janowicz2012}.
\section{Method}
\subsection{Target indicators and base nomenclatures}
We tested our method on dry, mesic and wet grasslands (EUNIS classes E1, E2 and
E3 respectively). We adapted the selected EUNIS indicators to meet the
requirements of remote sensing analysis. We also adopted EAGLE nomenclature when
possible to increase interoperability and further re-use. The table
~\ref{tab_indicators_classes} describes the indicators that are needed to
identify and hence classify the biotopes according to the EUNIS classification
hierarchy. The EUNIS classification hierarchy is built upon different
environmental indicators to differentiate between classes.

\subsection{Overview of the Automated EUNIS Habitat Mapping System}
% EU-HMS?
This section describes the developed method for classifying EUNIS habitats by
using data mining algorithms to generate rules based on remote sensing, digital
surface model (DSM) and digital terrain model (DTM) derived statistics of
pre-segmented polygons. The method's use of ontologies and the advantage
therein is also explained.\\
The system is comprised of (1) attaching
formalized habitat indicators from expert knowledge to pre-segmented polygons,
(2) rule generation by running data mining algorithms over randomly selected
polygons and using the habitat indicators as class labels, (3) importing rules,
EUNIS classes and polygon attributes into an ontology and finally (4)
classifying polygons with the Fact++ reasoner \citep{Tsarkov2006} and writing
results back to the database. An overview of the complete workflow is shown in
figure ~\ref{fig_full_workflow}.\\
The software relies on a PostgreSQL database back-end with PostGIS extensions
enabled and various open source Python and Java libraries to interact with the
database, convert files and execute a reasoner over the created OWL file.
SQLAlchemy is used for database interaction and data management is done with
the Python Data Analysis Library (Pandas) \citep{McKinney2010}. The OWLAPI is
used to interact with the OWL files and execute the FaCT++ reasoner
\citep{Tsarkov2006}. The software is freely available and is released under an
open source license.

        statistics are calculated for each combined polygon.
        2) Training and testing data are created and saved in the database.
        3) The training data is loaded into the data mining module and the
        rules are generated for the ``wetness" indicator
        4) The rules are imported into the OWL ontology along with the testing
        data as individuals. The reasoner performs A-box reasoning to determine
        class membership.
    } 
\label{fig_full_workflow}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Formalization of Expert Knowledge}
EUNIS class descriptions and interpretation guidelines \citep{EUNISManual} were
used to develop a set of indicators to accurately formalize certain habitats
with regard to the infer-ability with available input data sets (see
~\ref{subsec_indicators_and_nomenclatures}). This formalization can then be
written to an OWL ontology, which is able to store complex logical connections
in a XML file. The goal is to produce what Janowicz describes
as a ``micro theory \citep{Janowicz2012} which can then be used to map other
theories by training the data mining algorithms for the new
region and using the reasoner. We hope that once good test sites are taken for 
a region (for instance the federal state of Rhineland Palatinate) that the data 
mining algorithms will not need to be re-trained, speeding up classification. 
We use environmental variables (e.g., wetness, soil maturity, etc.) from the 
classification schemes and concepts from EAGLE to create a comprehensive 
interoperable vocabulary. This process involved attaching indicators from 
EUNIS, newly created indicators by NATFLO and EAGLE
to each biotope. An example of a EUNIS class, E2.22
``Sub-Atlantic lowland hay meadows'' modelled with selected remote sensing
indicators is written in description logic (DL) below
~\ref{eq:description_logic}.
\begin{equation}
\begin{align*}
%\begin{split}
E2.22 &\equiv wetness \exists \{``mesic''\} \\
&\qquad {} \land hydromorphic \exists \{``false''\} \\
&\qquad {} \land immature\_soil \exists \{``false''\} \\
&\qquad {} \land species\_richness \exists \{``false''\} \\
&\qquad {} \land usage \exists \{``mowing''\} \\
&\qquad {} \land usage\_intensity \exists \{``medium''\} \\
\end{align*}
\label{eq:description_logic}
\end{equation}
\subsection{Rule Generation with Data Mining ALgorithms}
First the data mining module splits data into training and testing data. 
The data mining module uses either the decision tree classifier (DT) from 
scikit-learn \citep{scikit-learn} or the Separability and Thresholds (SEaTH)
algorithm \citep{Nussbaum2006} but the method can be extended to use other
algorithms as long as the algorithm can generate a rule-set that can be
converted to OWL or into SQL queries. After the algorithms produce rules for 
each indicator, these are then added as facet restrictions to an OWL ontology. 
The polygons from the testing table are loaded from the database as individals 
into the same ontology and the reasoner FaCT++ classifies all 
polygons according to the rules. The classification  results by the reasoner 
is written to the database. The full workflow is shown in  figure 
\ref{fig_full_workflow}.
%Due to performance considerations we  
%performed the biotope classification in SQL queries. 
\subsection{Chosen Data Minin Algorithms}
The Separability and Thresholds (SEaTH) algorithm \citep{Nussbaum2006}
statistically identifies characteristic features and their thresholds. It has
been used on remote sensing data for land cover classification \citep{Gao2011}
and nuclear installation classification \citep{Nussbaum2006}. Using training
data, the algorithm determines the separability of the object classes and then
calculates the thresholds for which the maximum separability can be achieved
using the given features. One benefit of the algorithm is that one does not
need many training objects. In \cite{Nussbaum2006}, for example, the authors
suggest using only very characteristic features for training and only used
around 10 samples per class. The authors also state that usually two features
per class is enough to produce accurate results.\\
%\subsection{Decision Tree Classifier}
The DT implemented in scikit-learn is a modified classification and regression 
tree (CART)\citep{scikit-learn}. We use an evolutionary search 
algorithm with 10 evolutions based on the Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms 
in Python \citep{DEAP_JMLR2012} software to find the best parameters. The 
DT fitted with the parameters chosen by the evolutionary search algorithm 
are then compared with a DT trained on all parameters and 
a a DT trained on the top 10 most important features as chosen by the Extra 
Trees (ET) classifier. A 5 fold cross validation is performed and rules from 
the highest overall accuracy DT is chosen. The ET classifier is a modified 
random forest without bootstrapping and instead of splitting on the most 
discriminative feature, random thresholds from candidate features are taken.
\subsection{Segmentation} 
\label{subsec_segmentation}
The iterative object-based image analysis is performed using Defiens eCognition
Server and segments the data using thresholds and multi-resolution approaches 
\citep{baatz2001ecognition}.
The segmentation process uses information solely from
aerial images based on spectral information (NDVI and Bare Area Index) and
height from the digital elevation model (DEM) to separate between biotic and
no-biotic features \citep{Tintrup2015}. The detailed pre-processing workflow is
shown in figure \ref{fig_pre-processing}.
\subsection{Validation} 
The data was divided into 20\% for training and 80\% for validation. For SEaTH
20 objects per class were used from the training data set because the algorithm
performs better with a smaller number of features \citep{Nussbaum2006}. We 
selected only objects that were identified to be herbaceous plants by the 
segmentation alorithm for testing and training. The testing 
data includes polygons of grasslands between trees in orchards and 
algricultural land which are grasslands.
\section{Data and Study Area}
All input data comes from the RLP Ordnance Survey (Landesamt f\"ur Vermessung 
und Geobasisinformation). The data is segmented by RLP AgroScience using
multi-spectral (B, G, R, NIR) orthophotos with a 0.2m ground resolution and a
2 x 2km tile size. The orthophotos are updated every 2 years and are used to
create the Digital Surface Model (DSM) using automated stereo matching. The
last available orthophotos are from 2013. The DTM and
DEM was produced using LiDAR ASCII point clouds acquired between 2003 and 2009
with a resolution of 0.5m.\\
\subsection{Thematic Maps} The RLP biotope map was last updated in 2015. The
agriculture data set (INVEKOS) is updated yearly. 
% The Forestry map is from 200X and the soil map is from 200X.

\begin{figure} \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{diagrams/pre_processing.png}
    \caption{Biotope, Agriculture, Forestry, Geology (soil maps) are unioned to
    then be joined by the segmented polygons derived from orthophotos. The
    features are joined together and get all properties associated from the
    dataset unless they conflict. When conflicts occur the corresponding column
    is marked as such.}

\end{figure}
Saarburg is an 200km$^{2}$ administrative district and is located in the
south-west of the federal state of Rhineland Palatinate (RLP), Germany.
Luxembourg borders the area to the west and the federal state of Saarland to
the South. RLP has a western european atlantic climate and has an economically
and culturally important viticulture industry along the Mosel and Rhine rivers.

\section{Results}
Training the data with the ET classifier yielded classification results of
100\% for indicators usage, wetness and

Mesic grasslands represented the most frequent grassland class in the Saarburg 
region. The classfication report and results from training the DT algorithm  
shows that it is well represented in the data.

The few dry grasslands in the Saarburg region really hurt the classifier's 
ability to learn from the data. Only one dry grassland classified as such fits 
the rule's definition of a dry grassland. The reasons for this could be due to 
the differences in data quality between the biotope map and the agriculture map 
with grasslands misclassified or a conceptualization problem with the 
translation from the RLP classification to EUNIS. 

Visually inspecting the data revealed that polygons were in fact grasslands, 
agricultural land or meadow as the height restriction and the class name 
``herbaceous plants'' from the segmentation properly excluded trees, artificial 
buildings, etc. The larger size of the thematic map's 
polygons means that a polygon of grasslands in between an orchard will still be 
assigned the orchard's label and EUNIS indicators. Even after creating the 
minimum size of a polygon set to 200m$^{2}$

\section{Discussion}
The missclassification of I1 - ``Arable land and market gardens'' is 
understandable as the EUNIS biotope classification specifically states that 
turf and sportsfields are excluded. Since I1 is ``species poor'' adding 
``species richness'' to the E2 rule reduced the number of polygons classified 
as I1 but also reduced the total number of E2 classes as well.\\
SEaTH shows much better separability when one chooses
larger objects and fewer training objects per class. Training SEaTH on a few
carefully selected objects being ideal class representations further increases
the separability, but the classification accuracy suffers when applied to the
complete data set. Thus, SEaTH appears to over-fit. Using two sets of rules
produced from different sized training data produced quite different results
when tested on the same dataset.
The biotope classification is much more accurate than the agricultural data and 
only polygons where both maps agreed shold have been selected.
\section{Conclusion} We showed an autkomated
workflow using ontologies and data mining algorithms can accurately classify
EUNIS habitat objects. Moreover, the use of ontologies if published on the
Internet can allow others to reuse the workflow and make their own
modifications.
